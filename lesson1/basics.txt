what is python?
to have instructions that your computer can execute

java, c - compiler will compile the source code into an executable(e.g. binary, bytecode)

python - interpreted language - interpreter will take the source code, will try to understand the source code, and will execute it.

in python, source code -> execute it

in compiled languages - source code -> binary/bytecode -> run the executable

python source code is in files with extension .py

with compiled language, you can "hide" the source code, by just distributing the binary(.exe), hard to decompile from binary.
